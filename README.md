# Esp32CameraServer

## Description
This is an implementation of a multi-stream mjpeg server using ESP-IDF. The only examples I found available that allow for multiple streams were done using the Arduino library. I wanted to stick with ESP-IDF and found little to no examples on how to achieve this. The purpose of this project is a proof of concept to show it is possible and maybe help others.

## Environment

This was built using ESP-IDF 5.0 on MacOS Sonoma with the VSCode plugin. Just make sure to set your ssid and password on your sdkconfig.
